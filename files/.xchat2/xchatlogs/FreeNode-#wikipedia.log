jui 17 22:54:00 <Phoenixwi>	recently I was reading up about WWII allied and axis equipment & weaponry
jui 17 22:54:01 <Golbez>	oh hey geniice
jui 17 22:54:09 <Golbez>	do you know if those stranded wikimaniacs were ever helped?
jui 17 22:54:14 <Phoenixwi>	we came astonishingly close to losing the war...
jui 17 22:54:30 <Golbez>	Phoenixwi- based on what?
jui 17 22:54:52 <Golbez>	them having certain items does not mean they possessed the means to use them in a large enough fashion to force another outcome
jui 17 22:54:53 <Phoenixwi>	they had rockets, assualt rifles, while we still using bolt action rifles and carpet bombers
jui 17 22:55:03 <Phoenixwi>	assualt rifles, thousands of them
jui 17 22:55:13 *	drextreme (n=chatzill@209.95.78.2) a rejoint #wikipedia
jui 17 22:55:14 <Phoenixwi>	and in about a year more they weould have had a nuke
jui 17 22:55:25 <Phoenixwi>	= gg
jui 17 22:55:57 <Golbez>	but that's just it. they needed a year.
jui 17 22:56:05 <Phoenixwi>	exactly
jui 17 22:56:06 <Phoenixwi>	we won
jui 17 22:56:11 <Phoenixwi>	but we came so close to losing
jui 17 22:56:14 <Golbez>	that doesn't mean they were close to winning, because recall, germany only persisted 9 months after the allied invasion of normandy
jui 17 22:56:24 *	tawker2 (n=chatzill@wikipedia/Tawker) a rejoint #wikipedia
jui 17 22:56:32 <Golbez>	i don't know if saying "if the war had gone on 125% longer, the germans would have won" is a fair assessment of their capabilities =p
jui 17 22:56:34 <Phoenixwi>	and taht invasion was almost postponed for two months because of weather
jui 17 22:56:43 *	tawker2 s'appelle maintenant tawker
jui 17 22:56:57 <Phoenixwi>	they're morale was shit you see
jui 17 22:57:05 <Phoenixwi>	that was a major problem
jui 17 22:57:11 <Phoenixwi>	after the invasion
jui 17 22:57:14 <Phoenixwi>	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panzer_VIII_Maus Golbez that could take on a troop of shermans and come out on top
jui 17 22:57:21 <Golbez>	especially considering this: based on what you said, it would have taken until April 1946 for Germany to have nukes. But the allies had nukes in August 1945. So... it's unfair to say Germany would have won if the war were extended a year, because that's ignoring the fact that we had nukes. =p
jui 17 22:57:35 *	Cyrius builds a machine that looks into alternate universes so that these "what if" questions can be settled once and for all
jui 17 22:58:03 *	ggreer est parti ()
jui 17 22:58:12 <Golbez>	that proves my point - the germans had the idea and the prototype, but completely lacked the capability to produce and use it in any numbers to be effective.
jui 17 22:58:13 <Phoenixwi>	Golbez you think the allies won easily?
jui 17 22:58:27 <Golbez>	did i say that?
jui 17 22:58:50 <Phoenixwi>	no that's a question you see, not a statement
jui 17 22:59:07 <Golbez>	right, but i'm wondering what encouraged that question
jui 17 22:59:22 <Phoenixwi>	you seemed to imply that the Germans were crap
jui 17 22:59:28 *	rainman-sr est parti ()
jui 17 22:59:34 <Golbez>	no, we didn't win easily (and nor did we win in 9 months - let's not forget the 4 years of war with the Soviets that wore Germany down)
jui 17 22:59:53 <Phoenixwi>	you also would have been pwned without the soviets...
jui 17 22:59:55 <Golbez>	no, i'm implying that by the time these advanced units were being designed and built, Germany's industrial base was mostly debris
jui 17 23:00:02 <Phoenixwi>	they were absolutly shit fighters but they still won
jui 17 23:00:05 <Golbez>	they had the ideas but not the means
jui 17 23:00:17 <Phoenixwi>	Golbez that's because of our bombing raids etc
jui 17 23:00:21 <Golbez>	right...
jui 17 23:00:35 *	krls-ca (n=chatzill@175.pool85-58-241.dynamic.orange.es) a rejoint #wikipedia
jui 17 23:00:41 <Phoenixwi>	but if we had declared war just 6 months later it would have been shite
jui 17 23:00:56 <Golbez>	my point is, saying "if the war had gone on another year the Germans would have won" is a very myopic view. so what if Germany would have had nukes in a year? we had them in only 3 months.
jui 17 23:01:04 *	ggreer (n=AngryPar@64.172.17.3) a rejoint #wikipedia
jui 17 23:01:11 <bumm13>	the Nazis inflicted a lot of casualties on the Russians at the same time while trying to invade the Soviet Union
jui 17 23:01:23 <Phoenixwi>	Golbex you wouldn't have had them without using captured german scientists
jui 17 23:01:32 <bumm13>	(although the campaign was doomed to failure)
jui 17 23:01:38 <gwern>	iirc, weren't we almost out of bomb fuel after the first 6 or so were made?
jui 17 23:01:39 <Phoenixwi>	you didn't even think it was possible
jui 17 23:01:43 <Golbez>	i think the bulk of the work was done prior to april 1945 but
jui 17 23:01:46 <Phoenixwi>	untill you captured a whole bunch of german scientists
jui 17 23:01:55 *	nazgjunk est parti ("DYWYPI? (Y/n)")
jui 17 23:02:02 <Phoenixwi>	Golbez no it was not you didn't even think nukes were possible
jui 17 23:02:06 <Golbez>	i'm not sure if i agree with that; once Germany failed to defeat the Soviet Union on its first push, its fate was sealed.
jui 17 23:02:11 <Phoenixwi>	you used german work and modified really fast
jui 17 23:02:11 <Ceiling_Cat>	Golbez - the nazis would never have gotten the atom bomb
jui 17 23:02:12 <bumm13>	the U.S. gleaned a lot from German science and technology during WWII
jui 17 23:02:15 <Ceiling_Cat>	for several reasons
jui 17 23:02:21 <bumm13>	(mostly for post-WWII benefit)
jui 17 23:02:24 <Golbez>	the main point of the invasion of Normandy was to stop the Soviets in Germany, instead of in France.
jui 17 23:02:27 <Ceiling_Cat>	(a) they miscalculated the amount of fissile material needed to start a chain reaction
jui 17 23:02:32 <Golbez>	And of course to accelerate the end of the war.
jui 17 23:02:51 <Ceiling_Cat>	(b) heisenberg's heavy water-moderated design could never have worked
jui 17 23:03:05 <Ceiling_Cat>	(c) they didn't know of any moderator except heavy water
jui 17 23:03:27 *	mavhc sets nuke +m
jui 17 23:03:29 <Golbez>	my point is, just because Germany had the ideas and prototypes of massively advanced weaponry does not in itself mean they were close to winning, even if the war had extended on years.
jui 17 23:03:33 <Phoenixwi>	that's why they would have needed another year...which was quite lucky
jui 17 23:03:39 <Ceiling_Cat>	oh, and (d) they lacked the cyclotron or any other capability of isolating the correct isotopes
jui 17 23:03:57 <Phoenixwi>	Golbez if they hadn't invaded the USSR you would have lost...
jui 17 23:03:57 *	nsh s'appelle maintenant [PLACEHOLDER]
jui 17 23:04:10 <drextreme>	But they DID invade the USSR, so all of this is moot.
jui 17 23:04:19 <drextreme>	Not to mention the victories in Africa.
jui 17 23:04:20 <Golbez>	Phoenixwi- there's two ways to handle that possibility
jui 17 23:04:22 <Phoenixwi>	yes they did, and that means we won
jui 17 23:04:37 <bumm13>	that's an oversimplistic conclusion
jui 17 23:04:38 <harej>	as i want you to be
jui 17 23:04:43 <Ceiling_Cat>	After the US dropped the bomb on hiroshima, the german nuclear scientists were confined in england and their quarters were bugged
jui 17 23:04:46 <Golbez>	well no, only one
jui 17 23:04:53 <Phoenixwi>	cos hitler wasn't only a fucktard he waas also crap a crap strategist
jui 17 23:04:58 <Ceiling_Cat>	the german scientists were incredulous that the US managed to build an A-bomb
jui 17 23:05:02 <Ceiling_Cat>	they thought it couldn't be done
jui 17 23:05:44 <Golbez>	germany invading the soviet union was indeed the #1 blunder of the war,
jui 17 23:05:45 <Phoenixwi>	http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4348497.stm that's very interesting Ceiling_Cat
jui 17 23:05:55 <Phoenixwi>	very much so
jui 17 23:06:02 <drextreme>	El Alamein was widely considered the turning point on the African front, and that was actually BEFORE the Battle of Stalingrad turned against the Germans.

jui 17 23:06:51 <Mike_H>	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3NPlsb3B7I
jui 17 23:06:55 <Mike_H>	there, now we're doing it right!
jui 17 23:07:01 <Ceiling_Cat>	Phoenixwi - I don't believe it
jui 17 23:07:04 <gwern>	Phoenixwi: personally, I think his performance before and early in th war establishes hitler's strategic credentials. that was some damned good maneuvering

jui 17 23:07:13 <Ceiling_Cat>	"The eyewitnesses he puts forward are either unreliable or they are not reporting first-hand information; allegedly key documents can be interpreted in various ways," said the influential news weekly Der Spiegel.

jui 17 23:07:35 <Phoenixwi>	gwern he had nothing to do with the blitzkreig tactics, he just ordered them to invade
jui 17 23:07:45 <gwern>	I mean, his calculation of what his enemies would or would not do and what tacks to take are some of the most masterful maneuvering I've ever seen
jui 17 23:07:45 <Phoenixwi>	he wasn't very good at all

jui 17 23:08:05 <drextreme>	The geniuses were the generals and admirals, many of whom were NOT nazis.

jui 17 23:08:24 <Golbez>	drextreme- right
jui 17 23:08:30 <Phoenixwi>	rommel was brilliant
jui 17 23:08:35 <Phoenixwi>	but he tried to defect
jui 17 23:08:37 <Phoenixwi>	and was killed
jui 17 23:08:56 <Golbez>	not defect - he was part of the plot to kill hitler
jui 17 23:08:57 <gwern>	getting the sudetenland, the propaganda, maneuvering the folks like the british, all of this was impressive realpolitik the likes of which we certainly haven't seen since
jui 17 23:08:58 <Ceiling_Cat>	Phoenixwi - no, he did not try to defect
jui 17 23:09:01 <Ceiling_Cat>	he tried to kill hitler
jui 17 23:09:08 <drextreme>	Hitler had a nasty habit of killing off his most talented associates due to nebulous concerns about loyalty.
jui 17 23:09:10 <Ceiling_Cat>	he was part of the july conspiracy
jui 17 23:09:20 <gwern>	Golbez: my understanding was that he knew of the plot but was not involved otherwise
jui 17 23:09:24 <Phoenixwi>	he was in that suitcase bomb thing wasn't he? WHere someone moved the bomb?> That's defecting...
jui 17 23:09:30 *	Ceiling_Cat boggles
jui 17 23:09:38 <Ceiling_Cat>	Phoenixwi - no, he didn't. Rundschedt survived the war
jui 17 23:09:50 <Ceiling_Cat>	Walter Model, hilter's "fireman", committed suicide at the end
jui 17 23:09:57 <drextreme>	He was SUSPECTED of having been involved in the July conspiracy.
jui 17 23:09:59 <Ceiling_Cat>	Reinhard Hydriech was killed by Czech resistance
jui 17 23:10:13 <drextreme>	But probably far less people were actually involved in that than were executed for it.
jui 17 23:10:15 <Ceiling_Cat>	Otto Scorzeny survived the war
jui 17 23:10:16 <Golbez>	drextreme- suspected by hitler. =p
jui 17 23:10:26 <Ceiling_Cat>	Those are some of hitler's most capable men
jui 17 23:10:43 <Phoenixwi>	there were loas of british plans to assasinate him, btw, none of them worked, evidently
jui 17 23:10:50 <Phoenixwi>	suicide bomb his train...
jui 17 23:10:51 <drextreme>	Personally, I think he used it as an excuse to conduct a second Night of the Long Knives.
jui 17 23:10:54 <Golbez>	why assassinate hitler?
jui 17 23:10:56 <Phoenixwi>	snipe him...
jui 17 23:11:06 <Golbez>	as the war was dragging on he became their best strategic asset
jui 17 23:11:08 <drextreme>	His charisma was the only thing that held Nazi Germany together.
jui 17 23:11:10 <Ceiling_Cat>	(although for different reasons - Hydrich was good at killing jews; Scorzeny was good at special ops; Rundscedth was considered the best overall german general)

jui 17 23:11:20 <Phoenixwi>	Golbez they were figthing a war against him, seems natural they'd want hm dead doesn't it?
jui 17 23:11:25 <Golbez>	and also he was a convenient excuse to continue into Germany
jui 17 23:11:30 *	Haley_ s'appelle maintenant Haley
jui 17 23:11:35 <drextreme>	The Reich lasted a few days past his death.
jui 17 23:11:44 <Golbez>	since the generals and admirals who would have replaced him would likely have sued for peace and withdrawn forces to defend germany proper
jui 17 23:12:00 <Golbez>	drextreme- not so much because he died, though, but because germany at that point was teeming with enemy troops. =p
jui 17 23:12:05 *	Ceiling_Cat wonders if the fate of Alois Brunner will ever be discovered
jui 17 23:12:05 <mavhc>	you can sue for peace?
jui 17 23:12:11 <drextreme>	Well, yeah, if you want to get nitpicky.
jui 17 23:12:13 <Ceiling_Cat>	mavhc - yes
jui 17 23:12:14 <Golbez>	mavhc- it's a phrase!
jui 17 23:12:23 <Ceiling_Cat>	Asking for terms is called 'suing' for peace

jui 17 23:12:41 <Phoenixwi>	at the end he still thought they could win, even though they had thje army were deserting and some commiting suicidee to prevent them being captured by the soviets lest they be sent to the gulags, and the russians were pouring into berlin
jui 17 23:12:42 <Ceiling_Cat>	anyway, Brunner is the last najor Nazi still at large
jui 17 23:12:47 <Ceiling_Cat>	he was last seen in Syria in the early 90s

jui 17 23:13:27 <Ceiling_Cat>	that would be amazing if they caught him and he were still alive
jui 17 23:13:35 <Phoenixwi>	there' bound be loads of SS guys living in the US...
jui 17 23:13:46 <Phoenixwi>	actually most of them would be dead by now
jui 17 23:13:47 <Golbez>	drextreme- true
jui 17 23:14:07 <drextreme>	Most former Nazis went to South America, methinks. Prominent ones, anyway.

jui 17 23:15:19 <Ceiling_Cat>	he picked Karl Doenitz
jui 17 23:15:31 <Phoenixwi>	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landkreuzer_P._1000_Ratte that's something else
jui 17 23:15:34 <Golbez>	Doenitz was a good choice for president of Germany, since his first priority then was to organize the orderly surrender of the forces under his command to *western* troops. =p
jui 17 23:15:54 <Phoenixwi>	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landkreuzer_P._1500_Monster and that just blows my mind, even if wouldn't have been much use in a real war
jui 17 23:15:56 <Golbez>	which reminds me of one good theory as to why Japan surrendered when it did.
jui 17 23:16:08 *	Sky2042 isn't a nobody...
jui 17 23:16:25 <Golbez>	Because the Soviets were rapidly advancing and it was far, far more advantageous to surrender to the Americans than the Soviets.

jui 17 23:17:01 <Golbez>	Ceiling_Cat- i didn't say that was why. i said it was a theory.
jui 17 23:17:22 <Ceiling_Cat>	The japanese imperial high command didn't know their forces in Manchuria were being routed when the decision was made to surrender

jui 17 23:18:44 <Golbez>	and Ceiling_Cat, he *did* pick Goebbels as his successor as Chancellor.
jui 17 23:19:33 <Golbez>	Hitler dissolved the office of Fuhrer und Reichskanzler, splitting it back into Reichsprasident (Doenitz) and Reichskanzler (Goebbels).
jui 17 23:19:49 <Phoenixwi>	Golbez how one arth would hte soviets get to japan though?
jui 17 23:20:08 <Golbez>	Phoenixwi- the same way the americans did
jui 17 23:20:11 <Phoenixwi>	there were a few secret arms deals between some soviets and the japs btw
jui 17 23:20:11 <drextreme>	I always figured the Soviet declaration of war was a token.
jui 17 23:20:19 <Phoenixwi>	a token?

jui 17 23:20:43 <drextreme>	I mean, since Japan surrendered very soon afterward.

jui 17 23:21:01 <Golbez>	and actually
jui 17 23:21:01 <Phoenixwi>	they declared war on japan when?
jui 17 23:21:14 <Golbez>	the actual action was in Manchuria, which is easily reached by land from the Soviet Union
jui 17 23:21:19 <Phoenixwi>	I didn't think the russians fired at ashot at the japs during WWII
jui 17 23:21:22 <Golbez>	August 9, 1945.
jui 17 23:21:24 <drextreme>	A few days before V-J Day.
jui 17 23:21:39 <Golbez>	The Japanese surrendered on August 15.

jui 17 23:22:15 <godling>	I just saw something rather strange on the English Wikipedia, but when I refreshed the page It wasn't there, I can't find anything in the Firefox cache, and there is no record of vandalism in the history of the article.
jui 17 23:22:26 <drextreme>	But in retrospect, the Soviets didn't (at least not officially) know about the atom bomb, so they would have had no (official) reason to expect a quick surrender.
jui 17 23:22:29 <Golbez>	"The invasion began at dawn on August 9, 1945, precisely three months after the German surrender on May 8 (May 9, 0:43 Moscow time)." IIRC, that was an agreement Stalin made at Yalta - three months after Germany falls, they break their neutrality pact with Japan.
jui 17 23:22:45 <Golbez>	godling- it's possible the vandalism was in a template linked in the article; what was the article?
jui 17 23:22:47 <Phoenixwi>	allies had far superior morale, and that can win beat a force of poorer morale easily even if they have faar superior weapons
jui 17 23:22:48 <drextreme>	Ah, that makes sense.

jui 17 23:25:01 <godling>	Golbez: Thanks for the help.
jui 17 23:25:15 <Sky2042>	oooo, scary Golbez.
jui 17 23:25:24 <Golbez>	Phoenixwi- but my general point is, germany didn't really have far superior weapons. by the times they were creating these ideas and prototypes, they lacked the industrial ability to produce them in any meaningful numbers.
jui 17 23:26:01 <drextreme>	Not to mention, all the codes were broken. We probably knew the weak points of all their advanced weaponry before they did.
jui 17 23:26:16 <Golbez>	yes, given a much longer and protracted war, and one in which they could recover their industrial base (i.e. one closer to what happened in World War I), they could have built these units and become a true threat
jui 17 23:26:18 <Phoenixwi>	hey also wouldn't have made any difference except inflict mroe caualsties, but  they sitll had the ideas
jui 17 23:26:22 <Golbez>	but that's not what happened.
jui 17 23:26:23 <Sky2042>	Ie, they lost the moment that they thought they could take on the behemoth US.
jui 17 23:26:46 <Golbez>	Sky2042- when did they do that?
jui 17 23:26:58 <Phoenixwi>	no they didn't...they could nearly have beaten the US...they lost when they took on the USSR
jui 17 23:26:59 <Sky2042>	Golbez: Germany didn't. Japan did. ^^
jui 17 23:27:02 <drextreme>	Overly simplistic and a tad jingoistic, but what the hell.
jui 17 23:27:03 <Golbez>	did we declare on them first, or they declare on us?
jui 17 23:27:04 <Golbez>	oh
jui 17 23:27:17 <Sky2042>	Then Germany declared a day or two after Japan.
jui 17 23:27:27 <Phoenixwi>	Brits started the whole thing lol, they declared war first
jui 17 23:27:39 <geniice>	Golbez very probably there were a bunch of people who got in late
jui 17 23:27:40 <drextreme>	After the invasion of Poland.
jui 17 23:27:41 <Golbez>	yeah, Japan going against America was a poor choice, unless they had gone all the way with it. Same thing with Germany - they could very well have defeated the Soviets if they had managed to succeed on their initial push. But whereas Germany failed, Japan simply didn't try.
jui 17 23:27:43 <Phoenixwi>	then the US backed them up after a a year
jui 17 23:27:46 <Sky2042>	Phoenixwi: That's an interesting interpretation of "declare"
jui 17 23:28:16 <drextreme>	If they'd brought just a bit more firepower to Pearl Harbor, the US fleet would have been crippled far worse.
jui 17 23:28:21 <godling>	Golbez: Japan has not been idle.
jui 17 23:28:23 <Phoenixwi>	Sky2042: no it isn't, he stood up on a  platform thing and said that he was declaring war on germany
jui 17 23:28:30 <Phoenixwi>	he wasn't attacked
jui 17 23:28:37 <Phoenixwi>	sure, he was acting for the good of eastern europe
jui 17 23:28:38 <Golbez>	I remember reading once that people in Washington were scared shitless after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Because some estimates showed (and I wish I could remember where I saw this) that if the Japanese invaded then, they could penetrate as deep as the Mississippi River before American forces could begin repelling them.
jui 17 23:28:45 <Phoenixwi>	and the world
jui 17 23:28:52 <Sky2042>	Phoenixwi: Lol...
jui 17 23:28:59 <drextreme>	Yeah, AFTER Germany declared war on Poland, thus breaking the appeasement treaty.
jui 17 23:29:22 *	Sky2042 checks to see if Germany ever did declare war on Poland.
jui 17 23:29:23 <Phoenixwi>	if churchill was in poower then they wouldn't even have gotten czechoslovakia
jui 17 23:29:32 <Golbez>	The main issues with World War 2 was that the bad guys tried to do too much, and not do it well.
jui 17 23:29:38 <Phoenixwi>	they'd have been wiped off the map quite fast
jui 17 23:29:44 <Phoenixwi>	exactly
jui 17 23:29:52 <Golbez>	Germany had initial successes in the Soviet Union but ultimately failed; Japan had a rousing success with Pearl Harbor but opted not to follow up.

jui 17 23:30:07 <drextreme>	I actually think Neville Chamberlain was acting quite well.
jui 17 23:30:21 <Sky2042>	drextreme: Germany didn't declare war. They only invaded Poland.
jui 17 23:30:23 <Phoenixwi>	and WWII was really a good vs evil war, WWI was just a dumb war between some people who felt they needed some exceitment but didn't think twice about killing 10 million people
jui 17 23:30:28 <drextreme>	He was keeping the interests of his own country and their allies in mind.
jui 17 23:30:32 <OverlordQ>	Phoenixwi: wiped off the face of the map with what?
jui 17 23:30:39 <drextreme>	And there are no good vs. evil wars.
jui 17 23:30:42 <Phoenixwi>	an army...
jui 17 23:30:44 <Golbez>	WW2 was essentially WW1 part 2.
jui 17 23:30:52 <OverlordQ>	who's army? not like brittian had *that* big of an army
jui 17 23:31:07 <Golbez>	WW1 was never really resolved, it was merely stalled for couple of decades.
jui 17 23:31:09 <drextreme>	And WW1 was the inevitable conclusion of a silly system of alliances forged in the late 19th century.
jui 17 23:31:11 <Phoenixwi>	OverlordQ: but the brits had the best army in the war, the best trained, taht is
jui 17 23:31:17 <Phoenixwi>	also they had the most experienced
jui 17 23:31:38 <Phoenixwi>	1 elite soldier > 3 conscripts any day
jui 17 23:31:43 <Sky2042>	Which in itself was due to the instability of the European countries caused by super-rapid expansion during the prior 400 years.
jui 17 23:31:45 <OverlordQ>	again, irrelevant.

jui 17 23:31:59 <Phoenixwi>	OverlordQ how is that irrelevant?
jui 17 23:32:01 <drextreme>	Probably the biggest mistake of World War 1 was the Treaty of Versailles.
jui 17 23:32:03 <Sky2042>	Which was due to discovery of the other places... etc etc.
jui 17 23:32:07 <OverlordQ>	10 divisions was not going to stop the germans
jui 17 23:32:09 <Sky2042>	drextreme: Yes.
jui 17 23:32:12 <Golbez>	and since WW2, apart from Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, there have been no further wars in Europe.
jui 17 23:32:16 <OverlordQ>	I dont care how good you say they were
